            The site builds successfully. GitHub Pages only supports one active deployment per repository, so we can't deploy PR previews to separate URLs.

            **For reviewers:**
            1. After this PR is merged, the changes will be deployed to the production site: https://${OWNER}.github.io/${REPO_NAME}/
            2. For previewing changes before merging, please check the "Files changed" tab or pull the branch locally.

            **For local preview:**
            \`\`\`bash
            git fetch
            git checkout ${context.payload.pull_request.head.ref}
            pnpm install
            pnpm run build
            npx serve@latest out
            \`\`\`

            Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
            
            **GitHub Pages Limitation:**
            Unfortunately, GitHub Pages doesn't support multiple separate preview environments from a single repository when using GitHub Actions workflows for deployment.
            
            To enable true PR previews with unique URLs, consider using:
            - Netlify or Vercel with automatic PR deployments
            - Other GitHub Pages alternatives that support preview environments
